Mini project: API
A simple web API with REST architecture where you can:
- Store persons with basic information such as their firstname, lastname and phonenumber.
- Store several interests that the persons have. Each interest has a title and a short description.
- Store several interests per person.
- Store several links to each interest a specific person has. The link is then connected to both the person and that interest.
